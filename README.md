# About Me:
I am a research professional interested in transforming data into knowledge and understanding.<br><br>As a microbiologist working in health and safety, I specialized in identifying and mitigating the probability of costly consequences during research with hazardous materials. This role offered the exciting opportunity to engage with a diversity of research and research methodologies in various fields. One commonality is the generation of a large amount of data (for example gene sequences) which must be analyzed, often with statistical and computational techniques such as machine learning. Such methods became of great interest to me, as such I aimed to learn to code and to apply these techniques to interesting questions.<br><br>As a neurobiology researcher, I tackle difficult projects that probe the neural mechanisms of vision. Here I learned to write custom scripts and apply statistical and machine learning techniques to data. As I enjoy bringing structure to ambiguous problems, the transformation of data into knowledge is the most fulfilling aspect of this work and I desire to learn and do more. <br><br>My current focus is everything data science and I actively work to expand my knowledge, skills, and abilities in this area. I enjoy programming in languages such as Python to perform data analysis and can employ tools such as machine learning algorithms to make predictions. I can also utilize APIs and web scraping techniques if the collection of data from JSON or HTML is necessary. I am familiar with the process of wrangling raw data of various types and the querying of relational database management systems via SQL. Finally, exploratory data analysis with Python packages such as Pandas, Numpy, and Seaborn is a necessary first step when analyzing any new dataset.
