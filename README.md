# About Me:
I am a quantitative research professional interested in transforming data into knowledge and insight.

As a microbiologist working in health and safety, I specialized in identifying and mitigating the probability of costly consequences during research with hazardous materials. This role offered the exciting opportunity to engage with a diversity of research and research methodologies in various fields. One commonality between fields is the generation of a large amount of data which must be analyzed, often with statistical and computational techniques. Such methods became of great interest to me. As such, I aimed to learn to code and to apply these techniques to interesting questions.

As a quantitative researcher in neurobiology, I tackled difficult projects that probed the neural mechanisms of vision. Here, I led data collection, engineering, and analysis efforts for multiple concurrent lines of independent research. I developed pipelines for the conversion of raw experimental data into datasets ready for analysis, and utilized data visualization, statistical inference, and machine learning algorithms to identify and analyze salient relationships between visual stimuli, neural activity, and behavior. I enjoy bringing structure to ambiguous problems, thus the transformation of data into knowledge was the most fulfilling aspect of this work and I desired to learn and do more. 

Currently, I am pursuing a Masters in Applied Data Science to deepen my knowledge, skills, and abilities. My primary tools for data science are Python and SQL for data extraction and cleaning. I perform exploratory data analysis with Python packages such as Pandas, Numpy, and Seaborn. I am also familiar with APIs and web scraping techniques for the collection of data from JSON or HTML file types. With organized datasets, I can utilize statistical inference and machine learning methods via Python pages such as Scikit-learn to describe data or make predictions.
